# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes go into the latest release line (currently `v2.0.0`) and the `main` branch. Older releases are not patched; please upgrade.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue, discussion or pull request for a security problem.**

Report it privately through GitHub: **Security → Advisories → "Report a vulnerability"** on this repository (<https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma-pipeline-windows/security/advisories/new>).
If you cannot use GitHub, open a public issue that says only that you have a security report and asks for a private contact. Do not include any details in that issue.

Please include:

- the version or commit, and a minimal Sigma rule, pipeline or command that reproduces the problem, with the observed and expected output;
- the impact you see (see the scope below) and, if you have one, a proposed fix.

## What we treat as a vulnerability

This processing pipeline rewrites Sigma rules (field names, log sources, conditions) before a pySigma backend converts them into queries. The following are in scope:

- **Injection through the pipeline:** a transformation in this pipeline that inserts rule-controlled content into queries or output without the escaping the backend would normally apply, or that lets a rule change the structure of the generated query.
- **Code execution or file access:** loading or applying this pipeline that leads to code execution, unsafe deserialisation, template evaluation of untrusted input, or file access outside the intended location.
- **Denial of service:** a small crafted rule that makes the pipeline consume excessive CPU or memory.
- **Release and supply chain:** weaknesses in this repository's CI or release workflows that could let an outsider publish or alter a released package.

**Out of scope (report publicly as bugs):**

- Wrong or missing field mappings, log source mappings or conditions that make a rule match more or fewer events than intended. These are important, but they are handled as normal issues and pull requests so fixes reach users quickly.
- A systemic and severe detection gap may be reported privately; the maintainers decide whether it becomes an advisory.

Report problems whose root cause is in pySigma itself (rule parsing, modifiers, processing pipeline machinery, conversion base classes) to [SigmaHQ/pySigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma). Report problems specific to this repository here.

## Our process

| Step                                                                          | Target                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Acknowledge the report                                                        | within 5 working days                         |
| Initial assessment and severity (CVSS 3.1)                                    | within 14 days                                |
| Fix developed in the advisory's temporary private fork                        | as soon as practical, normally within 90 days |
| Coordinated release, then GitHub Security Advisory published (CVE via GitHub) | at the fix release                            |

- We credit reporters in the advisory unless they ask not to be credited.
- When a fix affects other SigmaHQ projects, we may coordinate their releases.
- We ask reporters to keep details private until the advisory is published or 90 days have passed, whichever comes first, unless agreed otherwise.
